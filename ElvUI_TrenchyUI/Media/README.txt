Place your installer splash image here.

WoW image requirements (Retail):
- Preferred format: .BLP (best), or .TGA (fallback)
- If using .TGA: 32-bit (RGBA) or 24-bit (RGB), no RLE compression
- Dimensions must be powers of two (e.g., 512x512, 1024x1024). They do not have to be square, but both width and height must be powers of two.

ElvUI Installer image sizing:
- The installer expects a wide banner, not a square. Use a 2:1 aspect ratio for best results.
- Recommended sizes: 512x256 or 1024x512 (preferred). Avoid 1:1 (e.g., 1024x1024) to prevent vertical squishing.
- File path cannot exceed 255 chars; avoid spaces and special characters.

Recommended: Convert your PNG to BLP for best quality & memory.
- Tool: BLPNG (command line) or BLPConverter GUI, or use the WoW Tools online converter.
- For TGA: Export as 32-bit uncompressed TGA from GIMP/Photoshop.

Suggested filename: TrenchyUI_Splash.tga (or .blp)
Tip: If you already have a square image, pad or crop it to 1024x512 before exporting to avoid distortion.
